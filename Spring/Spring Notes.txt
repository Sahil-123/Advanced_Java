- to create config class we have to annotate the class with @Configuration.
- for every configuration we have to pass it in getServletConfigClasses method it will pass to spring container.

- configuration class is normal class.
- getServletConfigClasses method for DispatcherServlet for configurarion.
- getRootConfigClasses method for spring container configuration before dispatcherServlet initilizing.


=> Beans
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@Component - auto create and register the object and @Component is class level annotation.
@Bean - manualy create and register the object in config class by using method and @Bean is method level annotation. it is used in config annoted class.



===> Task
- 6 class and auto register with spring container.
- Mannualy register String, char[], LinkedList, Temple, Spoon, Mug, Snake, Map, Properties.


Question:

1) how the server know which class is initializer class.
	In Spring Framework, the server knows which class is the initializer class by looking for a class that implements the WebApplicationInitializer interface. 
	This interface has a single method, onStartup(), which is called by the server when the application is starting up.


2) how the spring containers will be invoked?
3) can we create multiple initilizer classes.
